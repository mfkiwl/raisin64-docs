Overview

Pipeline Stages
---------------

.. note::
   In general, all functional units are coded as combinational logic, with explicit register stages dividing up the processing pipeline.  This was done intentionally to allow expermintation and easy combining/splitting of functionality into however many registered stages are necessary to meet timing.  The pipeline register modules/files are suffexed with <name>_reg.
